PETROL STATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
(Enterprise-Ready Web Application using Laravel)
1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 Background

Petrol stations handle complex daily operations such as fuel stock control, pump monitoring, staff management, sales tracking, and financial settlement. Traditional manual or semi-automated systems often lead to errors, fuel losses, lack of transparency, and operational inefficiencies.

With the growth of fuel stations and the need for real-time monitoring, there is a strong requirement for a centralized, scalable, and secure Petrol Station Management System (PSMS).

1.2 Problem Statement

Most petrol stations face the following problems:

Inaccurate fuel stock records

Manual settlement errors

Fuel loss and theft detection challenges

Poor staff accountability

Limited reporting and analytics

No centralized user role control

1.3 Proposed Solution

The proposed system is a web-based Petrol Station Management System built using Laravel, designed to:

Automate daily operations

Provide real-time fuel and sales tracking

Improve transparency and accountability

Support future expansion (multi-station, mobile apps, integrations)

2. OBJECTIVES
2.1 General Objective

2.2 Specific Objectives

Manage tanks, pumps, fuel types, and stock

Track pump-wise and staff-wise sales

Handle shift-based settlements

Manage users with roles and permissions

Detect fuel losses and discrepancies

Generate detailed operational and financial reports

Ensure data security and auditability
